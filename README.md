**MEME**, (or MemeEconomy Market Evaluator) offers a set of tools to analyze the market at [r/MemeEconomy](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy). This project is no longer in active development. If anyone is willing to maintain this project, send out an email to contact@param.me.

## What is MemeEconomy?
[r/MemeEconomy](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy) is a subreddit where individuals can buy, sell, share, make, and invest in memes freely. Individuals will also get updates on the market, and be able to collaborate with other fellow meme traders.

## How does it work?
Users start with 1000 MemeCoins and can freely invest in memes. Once a meme has been invested in, [a bot](https://github.com/MemeInvestor/memeinvestor_bot) evaluates the user's investment after 4 hours. The user will either profit or lose MemeCoins based on how many upvotes the meme recieved. For more details regarding account setup and firm transacations, [visit the official site](https://meme.market/).

## Available tools
**MEME** offers an [investment return](calculator/investment-return) calculator as well as a [break even](calculator/break-even) calculator. [Both calculators support deep-linking](calculator/README.md). Additionally, **MEME** offers [MemeAdviser](https://github.com/paramt/MemeAdviser) - a reddit bot that analyzes the market and sends investment recommendations right into your PMs.

## Who's behind this?
MemeEconomy is a large community with many [developers](https://github.com/MemeInvestor/memeinvestor_bot#9-authors) and [moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/about/moderators/). **MEME** is a project by [Param Thakkar](https://www.param.me) and is not associated with MemeEconomy.

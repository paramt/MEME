**MEME** is a set of tools to analyze the market at [r/MemeEconomy](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy). The project is currently in **beta** and frequent changes should be expected.

### What is MemeEconomy?
[r/MemeEconomy](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy) is a place where individuals can buy, sell, share, make, and invest in memes freely. Individuals will also get updates on the market, and be able to collaborate with other fellow meme traders.

### How does it work?
Users start with 1000 MemeCoins and can freely invest in memes. Once a meme has been invested in, [the bot](https://github.com/MemeInvestor/memeinvestor_bot) evaluates the user's investment after 4 hours. The user will either profit or lose MemeCoins based on how many upvotes the meme recieved. For more details regarding account setup and firm transacations, [visit the website](https://memes.market/).

**MEME**, (or MemeEconomy Market Evaluator) offers a set of tools to analyze the market at [r/MemeEconomy](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy). The project is currently in **beta** and frequent changes should be expected.

## What is MemeEconomy?
[r/MemeEconomy](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy) is a place where individuals can buy, sell, share, make, and invest in memes freely. Individuals will also get updates on the market, and be able to collaborate with other fellow meme traders.

## How does it work?
Users start with 1000 MemeCoins and can freely invest in memes. Once a meme has been invested in, [a bot](https://github.com/MemeInvestor/memeinvestor_bot) evaluates the user's investment after 4 hours. The user will either profit or lose MemeCoins based on how many upvotes the meme recieved. For more details regarding account setup and firm transacations, [visit the official site](https://memes.market/).

## Available tools
Currently, **MEME** offers the [investment return](calculator/investment-return) and the [break even](calculator/break-even) calculators. Some tools like the **Investment Analyst AI** and the **Portfolio Manager** are still a work-in-progress and will be released in the near future.

## Who's behind this?
MemeEconomy is a large community with many [developers](https://github.com/MemeInvestor/memeinvestor_bot#9-authors) and [moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/about/moderators/). **MEME** is a project by [Param Thakkar](https://www.param.me) and is not associated with MemeEconomy.
